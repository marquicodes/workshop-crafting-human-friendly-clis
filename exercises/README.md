# Build a CLI tool with Node.js core

Through these exercises you're going to build a CLI tool with APIs that are
available in Node.js core. This tool will allow you to input notes and save
store them as daily notes in Markdown files.

## Start here: Create a skeleton CLI

You'll want to be in the `exercises` directory in your terminal:

```bash
cd exercises/
```

Now you can generate a skeleton CLI by running the [create-skeleton-cli](./create-skeleton-cli)
shell script in your terminal:

```bash
./create-skeleton-cli
```

## Running your CLI

```bash
# Run the CLI entrypoint script directly
./takenote/cli.js
```

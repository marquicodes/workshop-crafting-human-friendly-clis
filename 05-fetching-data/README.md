# 05 - Fetching data

https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v18/globals/#fetch

A browser-compatible implementation of the fetch() function was introduced in v17.5.0.

It is labelled as an experimental API.

When used in a script, you'll get a warning:

```
(node:77768) ExperimentalWarning: The Fetch API is an experimental feature. This feature could change at any time
```

You can stop using this experimental API by using `--no-experimental-fetch`, alternatively the error can be suppressed with `--no-warnings`.

The MDN docs for the fetch function [can be found here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)

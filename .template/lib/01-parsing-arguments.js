/*
  == Exercise 01: Parsing arguments ==

  Add argument parsing that supports the following scenarios:

  ```
  takenote --note "Today I did a lot of coding"

  takenote --note "Today I did a lot of coding" --private

  takenote --note "Today I did a lot of coding" \
    --note "I also made dinner"

  takenote -n "Today I did a lot of coding" \
    -n "I also made dinner"

  takenote -n "Today I did a lot of coding" -p
  ```
*/

export function parseArguments() {
	return {};
}
